# My-Introduction

Hello
My name is Ayush Pattanaik and I am an engineering student. I am currently studying Information Technology engineering at Veer Surendra Sai University  of Technology. I am interested in cloud computing and hope to pursue a career in this field.
I am a hardworking and dedicated student. I am always willing to learn new things and I'm eager to face challenges. I am a team player and work well with others, but I can also work independently when necessary.
I seek challenging opportunities where I can fully use my skills for the success of the organization. I am looking forward to learning more about cloud computing and hope to one day be able to make a positive impact in the field.
